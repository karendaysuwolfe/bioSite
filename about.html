            <p>
              Nicholas Wolfe was born on February 9, 1990, in Mora, Minnesota, where he grew up and later joined the Army as a diesel mechanic at the age of 17. After moving to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina when he was 21, he started his career in the automotive industry, working in various positions at a Toyota dealership.
          
              During this time, Nicholas pursued a two-year degree in IT from a local college, which eventually led him to secure a state IT job in South Carolina. He later found a better-paying opportunity in North Carolina and moved to Raleigh, where he still works for the state at another agency today.
          
              Nicholas has a passion for travel, which first sparked when he was growing up and wanted to explore the state of Minnesota. His favorite travel destination so far has been Zurich, Switzerland, where he was impressed by the city's cleanliness and simplicity. The most adventurous trip he has taken was to Mexico, which was also his first international trip and opened his eyes to the world of international travel. Nicholas prefers to travel in a group, as he is an introvert and finds comfort in having others around him. He saves up money for his trips and pays for his flights and hotels in advance to have more spending and emergency money on hand.
          
              Nicholas is also an IT enthusiast, who got into computer building and servers from a young age when he was experimenting with his family's computer. The most rewarding experience for him was building his first computer, which he finally did a few years ago. He has experience setting up networks and prefers Ubiquiti products, which he considers more of a prosumer product. He makes sure to change internal IPs, forward necessary ports, and secure his network with an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).
          
              In terms of recent advancements in networking and server technology, Nicholas is most excited about the availability of gigabit speeds and the new software that he can run in Docker containers, such as BitWarden, a password management system that he can run securely on his own network.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <h3>What first sparked your interest in travel?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <p>When I was growing up, I always dreamed of traveling and exploring just the state of MN. Then when I got to go to a lot of different places, I wanted to go to other states and then other countries. After visiting Mexico to meet and see you, I then wanted to go to more countries.
              </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What has been your favorite travel destination and why?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>I would have to say Zurich, Switzerland. I loved how clean it was. It also was a simple city and quiet one at that. It was great to see how another culture was that had some relations with American culture.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>What is the most adventurous trip you have taken?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>I would say to Mexico to meet you. Up to that point, I never left the country and was indifferent about traveling there by myself because of everything you hear on the news. I honestly think it was the most eye awakening trip that made me fall for international travel.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>What kind of travel do you prefer: solo or with others?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>Group. As you know, I am an introvert and I would have trouble talking to people or asking for help if I ever needed it. Being in a group is more fun because it is fun to enjoy destinations with others.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>How do you plan and budget your trips?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>As of right now, I just save up money, and use my credit card as it is no foreign transactions fee. I also prepay my flights and hotels at least 6 months in advance to have more spending and emergency (just to be safe) money on the trip.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>How do you maintain your passion for travel with your other interests and responsibilities?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>Well, I work for the state of NC doing IT, and have been doing it for almost 5 years now, in those first 3 years, I never took any vacations just because I had nowhere to go. I saved up a lot of vacation time since then and have more than enough time to go on a many months trip if I was able too.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>How did you get into computer building and servers?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>When I was little, my mom bought a Gateway desktop PC. Windows 98 was not so good with the user access, and you could pretty much delete any file (important or not) and I went into the Local C drive deleting files because our hard drive was getting full (20GB hard drive at the time). Then I was able to actually fix that issue on my own and recover the family files. My mom was still mad at me though.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>What has been your most rewarding experience in building computers and servers?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>When I built my first computer which was recent.  I always knew how to do it, but it wasnâ€™t till a few years ago I was able to afford building one. 
                </ul>
              </li>
              <h3>Can you walk us through your process of setting up a network and maintaining its security?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>In the beginning, I like to use Ubiquiti products as they are more of a prosumer product.  At first, I will make sure I have an active connection and then change the internal IPs to a 10.x.x.x and then make sure the Wi-Fi name and password are changed from the default.  After that, I will make sure that the ports I need to forward are forwarded and all my equipment is working properly.   I also use an IPS or also know as an Intrusion Prevention System which keeps my network secure as it can.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <h3>What are some of the latest advancements in the field of networking and server technology that you are most excited about?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>I am glad we are able to get above Gig speeds in my area.  AT&T offers a 2 Gig, and 5 Gig connection in my area that is under 200 dollars.  Google Fiber offers a 2 Gig connection in addition to its regular 1 Gig.  Another thing I always like is seeing all the new software that I can run in a Docker.  For example, BitWarden is a password management, but it is locked down on my network and I can store my passwords without any company having control of it.  The downside is, if someone can get into my system, I only have myself to blame.
